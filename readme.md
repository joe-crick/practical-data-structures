A lot of the example uses of data structures are too abstract to be practical. This repository aims to present practical uses of data structures in modern, front-end applications. This will _not_ be a tutorial on how to create data structures. Those patterns are well documented elsewhere. Rather, it will focus on the how, why, and when to use specific data structures. This respository is a companion to my blog series on practical data structures [forthcoming].
